<h3 class="harka">Q: Will I get banned for buying gold?</h3>
<div>
<p class="arkan">The consensus among seasoned real world traders is that the likelihood of a buyer being being banned is extremely low, Jagex mainly targets big time sellers and accounts originating from flagged IP addresses, particularly those from China. RS GoldShark operates in the USA. If you feel more comfortable making multiple smaller, less conspicuous in-game trades, or have any other special requests, we'll be happy to accommodate you. (Though we will not be able to transfer via drop trading.)</p>
<p class="arkan">In closing, you are more likely be banned by monkfishing without pants on.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="harka">Q: Why should I buy from you?</h3>
<div>
<p class="arkan">We value our commitment to provide the most reliable and rewarding game enhancement experience. We always keep up with the market to ensure our prices are highly competitive and keep our delivery availability updated and accurate so that you can be confident you've made the right choice. When you place your order, we immediately receive mobile notifications so we can minimize the wait time and give you the best service possible.</p>
<p class="arkan">Other services may use a third party delivery system where orders are dispatched to a network of gold farmers. This decentralized method leads to little accountability on the part of the people actually performing the deliveries. As shown by some of their reviews, they may try to defraud you by asking for the gold back after the delivery or asking for personal information. This is why some suspiciously warn against these things on their own service; it's because it’s not actually them fulfilling the order. RS GoldShark is run by a small dedicated team of Runescape veterans who carry out each order promptly and honestly.

<h3 class="harka">Q: How fast will I get my gold?</h3>
<div>
<p class="arkan">We know your time is valuable and make every effort to perform each delivery as quickly as we can. During our regular hours of operation (approximately 11am to 2am EST). we like to set our delivery guarantee at within one hour, although a great majority of trades can be completed much quicker than that. As soon as your order is placed, we're immediately alerted where ever we are, and your delivery becomes our first priority. If you find our regular hours of operation inconvenient, please feel free to contact us via PlayerAuctions messaging to make an appointment and we'll be happy to serve you.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="harka">Q: It's my first time buying gold, how do I know this is legit?</h3>

Once your payment is submitted, it's kept by PlayerAuctions until you confirm that we've completed the delivery to your satisfaction--then, and only then, do we receive any payment.</p>
