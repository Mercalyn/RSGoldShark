# RSGoldShark
Single page website created for RSGoldShark circa Aug 2014

Version control not on Github. I used to put the version number in the actual filename.
Spaces and Tabs got messed up in the .html file because I literally used Notepad.exe back then. xD

Also, the naming convention that I used back then does a terrible job at describing what the variable or class/ID name actually does. I believe this has improved over the last few years.
